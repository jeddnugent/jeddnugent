### [SMI Food Journal](https://github.com/jeddnugent/SMI-Food-Journal)

SMI Food Journal is a full stack project created for [Successful Minds Institute](https://successfulminds.com.au). 
The purpose of the journal is to allow clients of SMI to track each meal they eat over the course of a week where they will
answer a series of prompts regarding their mood and the enviroment around the meal which then will be accessed by practitioners on a subsequent consultation.
The information gained by these surveys will then help inform futher advice and treatment as this program will aid the first step for weight loss clients.
This information allows practitioners to best help their journies through hypnotic laparoscopic banding.

##### [My Final year Capstone project](https://github.com/jeddnugent/University-Projects/tree/main/Capstone%20Project/ouchButton_v2/ouchButton_v2_personal)
The Ouch Button was a combination of an Arduino and Web-based project which partnered with Scope Australia to build a working prototype that can help us improve the arduous wheelchair prescription process. 
When a wheelchair user experiences pain, they can press The Ouch Button, which captures the time and GPS location, making it easier for therapists to identify situations that are causing pain. 
All of this data could then be visualised on a website while maintaining strict data privacy.
