          <h2>Enhancements made to this website.</h2>
          <h3><a href="index.html#enhancementOne">Parallax</a></h3>
          <p>
            
            The Parallax adds a lot more character and interest to a page which wasn’t required for the completion of this assignment. The Parallax basically works as an interactive background. The specific technique was borrowed from another site which can be seen cited in the HTML code for this page and the technique consists of fixing a background image to a page which can be overlayed by a section or any other element as it is fixed to the page unlike the other elements which react to the scroll.

          <h3><a href="product.html#jump">Image Jump</a></h3>
          <p>
            
            The way this jump was created was through the use of CSS animation which isn’t something we’ve explored at all during our tutorials so definitely goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. This specific technique was adapted from another website's code which is cited above the specific CSS styling. The way this code works is adding an animation cycle to an object through the id “jump” on specific images on the product page. This animation consisted of adding a translation in the Y axis by 20px over the period of the animation which in this case was set to 1 second.
